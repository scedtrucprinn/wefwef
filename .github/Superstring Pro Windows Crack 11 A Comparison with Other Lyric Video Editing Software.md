## Step 1: Select and Drag a Song into the Software
 
First, you need to download and install Superstring Pro from its official website[^1^]. You can try it for free or buy it for $69.99. Once you have installed it, launch it and you will see a sleek and stylish interface that is easy to navigate.
 
To create a lyric video, you need to select and drag a song that you want to use into the software. You can also browse to the file's location and open it. Superstring Pro supports various audio formats, such as .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .flac, .ogg, and more.
 
Once you have imported your song, you will see its waveform on the timeline at the bottom of the screen. You can play, pause, rewind, or fast-forward the song using the controls on the left side of the timeline. You can also adjust the volume of the song using the slider on the right side of the timeline.
 
## Step 2: Copy and Paste Your Lyrics and Customize Their Styles, Colors, Fonts, and Effects
 
Next, you need to copy and paste your lyrics into the software. You can find your lyrics from various sources online or write them yourself. If your song has ID3 tags that contain lyrics, Superstring Pro will automatically find them and display them on the screen.
 
To edit your lyrics, click on the "Edit" button on the top right corner of the screen. You will see a text editor where you can type or paste your lyrics. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to copy (Ctrl+C), paste (Ctrl+V), undo (Ctrl+Z), redo (Ctrl+Y), cut (Ctrl+X), select all (Ctrl+A), and delete (Delete).
 
You can customize your lyrics by changing their styles, colors, fonts, and effects. To do so, click on the "Style" button on the top right corner of the screen. You will see a panel where you can choose from various options:

- Text Style: You can change the alignment (left, center, right), spacing (line height, letter spacing), shadow (color, blur), outline (color, width), glow (color), gradient (start color, end color), and pulse (speed) of your text.
- Text Color: You can change the color of your text by using the color picker or entering a hex code.
- Text Font: You can change the font of your text by choosing from over 100 fonts available in Superstring Pro.
- Text Effect: You can add some cool effects to your text by choosing from over 20 presets available in Superstring Pro.

You can preview your changes in real time on the screen. You can also apply different styles to different parts of your lyrics by selecting them and changing their options individually.
